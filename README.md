# I-BOT
Automation specialized concretely for cloning user-specified instagram account(s) using an auxiliary GUI. 

Currently capable of dynamic filtration of possible targets by a valid user-defined criteria and performing a deep copy of account(s)' content wherein multiple are treated as one.

Soon to be added a functionality invoking sycalls for the sequential removal of the locally copied content prior to uploading alongside a multi-threaded feature for organic behaviour and account self-management.
